                    <p>Online recommendation systems are prone to create filter bubbles,
                        whereby users are only recommended content narrowly aligned
                        with their historical interests. In the case of media recommendation, this can reinforce political polarization by
                        recommending
                        topical content (e.g., on the economy) at one extreme end of the
                        political spectrum even though this topic has broad coverage from
                        multiple political viewpoints that would provide a more balanced
                        and informed perspective for the user. Historically, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) has been used to diversify result lists
                        and
                        even mitigate filter bubbles, but suffers from three key drawbacks:
                        (1) MMR directly sacrifices relevance for diversity, (2) MMR typically diversifies across all content and not just targeted
                        dimensions
                        (e.g., political polarization), and (3) MMR is inefficient in practice
                        due to the need to compute pairwise similarities between recommended items. To simultaneously address these limitations, we
                        propose a novel methodology that trains Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)
                        for targeted topical dimensions (e.g., political polarization). We then modulate the latent embeddings of user preferences
                        in a state-of-the-art VAE-based recommender system to diversify
                        along the targeted dimension while preserving topical relevance
                        across orthogonal dimensions. Our experiments show that our
                        Targeted Diversification VAE-based Collaborative Filtering (TDVAE-CF) methodology better preserves relevance of content to
                        user
                        preferences across a range of diversification levels in comparison to both untargeted and targeted variations of Maximum
                        Marginal
                        Relevance (MMR); TD-VAE-CF is also much more computationally
                        efficient than the post-hoc re-ranking approach of MMR..</p>

                        <p>Shen, T.; Mai, Z.; Wu, G.; and Sanner, S. In Proceedings of the 31th international conference on the topic of the World
                            Wide Web (<b>WWW-22</b>),

                        <p>Managing uncertainty in preferences is core to creating the next generation of conversational recommender systems (CRS).
                            However, an often-overlooked element of conversational interaction is the role of clarification.
                            Users are notoriously noisy at revealing their preferences, and a common error is being unnecessarily specific, e.g.,
                            suggesting "chicken fingers"
                            when a restaurant with a "kids menu" was the intended preference.
                            Correcting such errors requires reasoning about the level of generality and specificity of preferences and verifying that
                            the user has expressed the correct level of generality.
                            To this end, we propose a novel clarification-based conversational critiquing framework that allows the system to clarify
                            user preferences as it accepts critiques.
                            To support clarification, we propose the use of distributional embeddings that can capture the specificity and generality
                            of concepts through distributional coverage
                            while facilitating state-of-the-art embedding-based recommendation methods.
                            Specifically, we incorporate Distributional Constrastive Embeddings of critiqueable keyphrases with user preference
                            embeddings
                            in a Variational Autoencoder recommendation framework that we term DCE-VAE.
                            Our experiments show that our proposed DCE-VAE is (1) competitive in terms of general performance in comparison to
                            state-of-the-art recommenders
                            and (2) supports effective clarification-based critiquing in comparison to alternative clarification baselines.
                            In summary, this work adds a new dimension of clarification to enhance the well-known critiquing framework along with a
                            novel data-driven distributional embedding
                            for clarification suggestions that significantly improves the efficacy of user interaction with critiquing-based CRSs.</p>

                        <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that
                            incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Recent advances in critiquing have leveraged
                            the
                            power of VAE-CF recommendation in a critiquable-explainable (CEVAE) framework that updates latent user preference
                            embeddings
                            based on their critiques of keyphrase-based explanations. However,
                            the CE-VAE has two key drawbacks: (i) it uses a second VAE head
                            to facilitate explanations and critiquing, which can sacrifice recommendation performance of the first VAE head due to
                            multiobjective
                            training, and (ii) it requires iterating an inverse decoding-encoding
                            loop for multi-step critiquing that yields poor performance. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel Bayesian
                            Keyphrase
                            critiquing VAE (BK-VAE) framework that builds on the strengths
                            of VAE-CF, but avoids the problematic second head of CE-VAE.
                            Instead, the BK-VAE uses a Concept Activation Vector (CAV) inspired approach to determine the alignment of item keyphrase
                            properties with latent user preferences in VAE-CF. BK-VAE leverages this alignment in a Bayesian framework to model
                            uncertainty
                            in a user's latent preferences and to perform posterior updates to
                            these preference beliefs after each critique — essentially achieving
                            CE-VAE's explanation and critique inversion through a simple application of Bayes rule. Our empirical evaluation on two
                            datasets
                            demonstrates that BK-VAE matches or dominates CE-VAE in both
                            recommendation and multi-step critiquing performance.</p>

                        <p>Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRSs) have recently started to leverage pretrained language models (LM)
                            such as BERT for their ability to semantically interpret a wide range of preference statement variations.
                            However, pretrained LMs are well-known to be prone to intrinsic biases in their training data,
                            which may be exacerbated by biases embedded in domain-specific language data(e.g., user reviews)
                            used to fine-tune LMs for CRSs. We study a recently introduced LM-driven recommendation backbone
                            (termed LMRec) of a CRS to investigate how unintended bias i.e., language variations such as name references or
                            indirect indicators of sexual orientation or location that should not affect recommendations manifests in
                            significantly shifted price and category distributions of restaurant recommendations.
                            The alarming results we observe strongly indicate that LMRec has learned to reinforce harmful
                            stereotypes through its recommendations. For example, offhand mention of names associated
                            with the black community significantly lowers the price distribution of recommended restaurants,
                            while offhand mentions of common male-associated names lead to an increase in recommended alcohol-serving establishments.
                            These and many related results presented in this work raise a red flag that advances in the language handling capability
                            of
                            LM-drivenCRSs do not come without significant challenges related to mitigating unintended bias in
                            future deployed CRS assistants with a potential reach of hundreds of millions of end-users..</p>

                        <p>Language-based Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)
                            have attracted growing attention as they allow users to express
                            and interactively refine their preferences in natural language.
                            However, there exist open problems in CRSs relating to the challenges
                            users face when articulating accurate natural language preferences
                            and the underlying technologies required to facilitate language-based interactions.
                            Our first contribution addresses the challenge that users have trouble specifying preferences
                            with the right level of specificity. We propose a clarification-based extension
                            of a critiquing-based interaction workflow for CRSs that outperforms state-of-the-art models.
                            In our second contribution, we explore the novel issue of unintended bias in language model-driven
                            conversational recommendation by proposing novel bias evaluation metrics and performing source of
                            bias analysis. In summary, this thesis investigates novel and important challenges in
                            the deployment of language that can help users express their preferences more accurately and allow
                            the identification and resolution of bias that arises in language-model-driven CRSs.</p>
